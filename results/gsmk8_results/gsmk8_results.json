        "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Calculate earnings from eggplants:**\n\n* Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so he earns 20 * $3 = $60 from eggplants.\n\n**2. Determine the remaining amount needed:**\n\n* He wants to make a total of $135 and has already earned $60, so he needs to earn another $135 - $60 = $75 from corn.\n\n**3. Calculate the price per ear of corn:**\n\n* Bennet has 25 ears of corn and needs to make $75 from them, so he should sell each ear for $75 / 25 = $3.\n\n\n**Answer:** Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
